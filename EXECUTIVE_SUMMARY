The Furniture Sales dataset is made up of 2,122 rows of orders made over the space of 4 years: 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019. Showing information about the Order id, Order date, Ship Date, Ship Mode, Customer ID, Customer Name, Segment, Country, City, State, Postal Code, Region, Product ID, Category, Sub-Category, Product Name, Sales, Quantity, Discount, Profit. 

PROJECT OBJECTIVES                                                                                              The objective of this project is to analyze Earthen Furniture’s sales data to evaluate overall sales performance, profitability trends, delivery efficiency, and regional sales distribution across the United States, with the aim of identifying key drivers of growth, profit decline, and operational improvement opportunities.


DATA CLEANING
I studied the dataset and noticed some inconsistencies. So I cleaned the dataset to suit the analysis I wanted to run. I need to articulate the time period each order spends from the day of order to the day of delivery. So I created a new column and named it “Duration”, which is the difference between Ship date and Order date. I also removed the Row ID since it wasn’t needed. Then I saved the dataset as a table for a better summary of the dataset.

WHAT THE DASHBOARD COVERS
1. Important KPI’s; 
Total Sales and YOY% in Sales.
Total Quantity of goods sold and YOY% in Quantity of goods,
Total Profit and YOY% in profit. 
2. The distribution of goods delivery in the shipping mode.
3. The distribution of goods in Sub-Categories.
4. The trend of Sales over months in the year.
5. The variation of shipping duration.
6. The Sales distribution across states and cities in the United States.


KEY INSIGHTS
1. There’s an increase in sales and quantity of goods sold in $742.0k (8%YOY) and 8.0k (11%YOY) respectively over the years, which shows more units are sold, demand is strong, the company is growing, but the profit of $18.5k (-57%YOY) shows that revenue growth is not translating into profit growth. 
2. Most goods; 28% of goods are delivered in 4 days.
3. 39% of goods are delivered in 5-7 days, which is higher than the 33% of goods that are delivered between 0-3 days, which shows that a substantial amount of goods are delivered after 4 days, hence the late delivery duration. 
4. November to December have the highest amount of revenue income, which translates to more goods being sold in the latter part of the year.
5. Our top-performing city is New York City with $75.6k in revenue.



STRATEGIC RECOMMENDATIONS
1. With increase in sales/revenue and quantity of goods sold year after year and decrease in profit, Management should conduct a detailed cost and margin analysis to identify drivers of profit volatility. This includes reviewing the cost of goods sold, operating expenses, pricing strategies, and product mix performance.
2. In the trend of sales over the years, it is advised that the company come up with strategies to increase sales in the first half of the year, rather than waiting till the end of the year to bring in good revenue. 


CONCLUSION
Overall, the analysis of the Earthen Furniture sales data reveals a business that is experiencing strong demand and consistent growth in sales volume, but struggling to convert this growth into sustainable profitability. While sales revenue and quantity sold have increased year over year, the significant decline in profit highlights underlying challenges related to cost management, pricing, discounts, or operational efficiency. Additionally, delivery timelines show that a large proportion of orders are fulfilled after four days, which may impact customer satisfaction and logistics costs. Seasonal trends indicate that revenue is heavily concentrated in the last quarter of the year, presenting an opportunity to improve performance during slower periods. By addressing cost drivers, optimizing delivery processes, and implementing strategies to balance sales throughout the year, Earthen Furniture can strengthen profitability while maintaining its growth trajectory
